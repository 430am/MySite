## Charles Bukowski

I don't love [Charles Bukowski](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/charles-bukowski), but I love a lot of his poetry and what he wrote about. Some of it is inaccessible or hasn't aged very well. Some of it is beautiful and speaks to the problems of modern life - being poor, alcoholism, struggles maintaining relationships, how much work sucks.

My favorite poem by Charles Bukowski comes from a collection of his early poems called ###The Roominghouse Madrigals###, published in 1988. It's called 4:30 A.M., and here it is:

### 4:30 A.M.

the fields rattle
with red birds;
it is 4:30 in
the morning,
it is always
4:30 in the morning,
and I listen for
my friends:
the garbagemen
and the thieves,
and cats dreaming
red birds
and red birds dreaming
worms,
and worms dreaming
along the bones of
my love,
and I cannot sleep,
and soon morning will come,
the workers will rise,
and they will look for me
at the docks,
and they will say,
"he is drunk again,"
but I will be asleep,
finally,
among the bottles and
sunlight,
all darkness gone,
my arms spread like
a cross,
the red birds
flying,
flying,
roses opening in the smoke,
and
like something stabbed and
healing,
like
40 pages through a bad novel,
a smile upon
my idiot's face

## the end

I first read this poem when I was in my late 20s or early 30s (don't really remember when), and I was working shit jobs, bartending or bar-backing, loading boxes at UPS, dating and sleeping around,  drinking too much, staying out too late - and it spoke to me.

I don't have a shit job anymore, I've got a family now, I don't drink very much anymore, and I go too bed way earlier than I ever thought I would - but I still love the poem. It's stark and beautiful and I can picture it, picture the point of view. I can feel it. 4:30 in the morning is the quietest part of the day/night. It's just perfect.
